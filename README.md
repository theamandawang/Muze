## Running Muze
The technology stack for Muze uses Next.Js, Node.js, Supabase, and Postgres. Running muze locally is quite! Just follow these steps: 
1. Clone the repo using `git clone`
2. Once you clone, lets move into the `Muze` directory by doing `cd Muze` and then moving into the `muze` directory by doing `cd muze`
3. If you don't have `npm` installed follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to install 
4. Now lets install the dependencies by running `npm install`
5. Muze can now run be locally at `http://localhost:3000` by running the command `npm run dev`

**The .env file:** if you get any errors saying that you are missing URLs or Keys it is probably related to the `.env` file. Muze uses Supabase, the Spotifiy API, and the TicketMaster API.  Make sure you do the following: 
1. Make sure the `.env` file exists in `Muze/muze` otherwise create it

For Supabase read the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs) to and add the following:
  * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` values and insert them in your `.env` file.
